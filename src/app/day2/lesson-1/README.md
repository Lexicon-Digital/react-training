# The useState hook

[Official Documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#state-hooks)

The useState hook is arguably the most important hook of all. It's job is to remember things, it is used to capture the users input.

## But first, state

What exactly is state? You can think of it as the current desired state of your application. React is **declarative** which means when you write code you are saying _I want my application to look like this_ as
opposed to **imperative** programming where you check what your program is doing, or the state that it is in, then decide what you want to do.

There is a great blog on declarative vs imperative programming on react [here](https://ui.dev/imperative-vs-declarative-programming)

to steal a specific example

> **Imperative**: Go out of the north exit of the parking lot and take a left. Get on I-15 going North until you get to the 12th street exit. Take a right off the exit like youâ€™re going to Ikea. Go straight and take a right at the first light. Continue through the next light then take your next left. My house is #298.
>
> **Declarative**: My address is 298 West Immutable Alley, Eden, Utah 84310

With the above in mind, lets learn about state in exercise 1
